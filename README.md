# How to use
1 - open anydesk<br>
2 - launch the program using python<br>
3 - wait for someone to connect to your machine, or connect to someone's machine<br>
4 - AnyXist will automatically grab their ip<br>

# Please read
If AnyXist says that the pulled ip is probably your own local ip, it is.
If the pulled ip has 443 as source port, its AnyDesk's server ip
If it's not 443 port and AnyXist doesen't say anything, it's your target's ip
